SpringDemo
==========

Simple Spring project with REST services and Spring Data.

To run the project you will need:
	- Maven 3 (may run with 2 also)
	- Eclipse (I used Juno version)
	- Maven's plugin for Eclipse (m2eclipse) installed in Eclipse
	- MySQL 5 database setup
	- Apache Tomcat 7



DB preparation.
After you've installed your MySQL 5 DB execute the SQL scripts placed in the 'scripts' folder of the project in the following order:
	- database_creation.sql
	- user_creation.sql
	- tables_creation.sql
	- population.sql

After that your database is ready to be used by the application.
