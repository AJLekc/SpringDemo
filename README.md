SpringDemo
==========

Simple Spring project with REST services and Spring Data.

To run the project you will need:  
    - Maven 3 (may run with 2 also)  
    - Eclipse (I used Juno version)  
    - Maven's plugin for Eclipse (m2eclipse) installed in Eclipse  
    - MySQL 5 database setup  
    - Apache Tomcat 7  
  
  
___
DB preparation.

After you've installed your MySQL 5 DB execute the SQL scripts placed in the 'scripts' folder of the project in the following order:  
    - database_creation.sql  
    - user_creation.sql  
    - tables_creation.sql  
    - population.sql  
  
After that your database is ready to be used by the application.
This may help if you have troubles to setup your DB - http://ma1stora.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/how-to-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82-%D1%81-mysql/
